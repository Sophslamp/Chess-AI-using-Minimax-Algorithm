# Chess-AI-using-Minimax-Algorithm
This is a Python program that plays chess using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The program uses the 'chess' module to represent the board and legal moves, and implements an evaluation function to assign a score to a given board position based on the number of pieces on each side.

# How-to-Use
To run the program, simply execute the chess_ai.py file in a Python environment: python chess_ai.py

The program will start a game between the AI player and a random player. The AI player uses the Minimax algorithm to select moves at a specified depth, which can be adjusted by changing the parameter passed to the 'play_game' function in the 'chess_ai.py' file.

During the game, the current board position is printed to the console along with the player's move. Once the game is over, the result is printed to the console.

# Requirements
This program requires the chess module, which can be installed using pip:
pip install chess
